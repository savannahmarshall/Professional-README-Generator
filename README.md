# Professional-README-Generator

## Description
This application is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. As a developer, I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.

While completing this application, I learned how to:

* Create interactive command-line prompts for a Node.js application.
* Utilize markdown.
* Use the `writeFile` method.
* Separate my JavaScript into different files to improve modularity and make navigation easier.
* Add a license and license badge to my GitHub projects in addition to learning more about licensing overall.

Some challenges I faced were:

* Navigating a larger amout of files than we are used to.
* I had an issue with the path I was using to import my generatemarkdown.js file to my index.js file that took a good amount of time to figure out.
* Styling the text for the questions using chalk. I struggled to create a function that would successfully change the text color. I would like to also add a different text color for the user's answers to the questions, which I may revisit in the future.
