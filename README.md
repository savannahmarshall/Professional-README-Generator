# Professional-README-Generator

## Description
This application is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. As a developer, I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.

While completing this application, I learned how to:

* Create interactive command-line prompts for a Node.js application
* Use the `writeFile` method
*
*

Some challenges I faced were:

* 
* 
* Styling the text for the questions using chalk. I struggled to create a working function that would change the text color. 
*

## Installation
To use this application, you must install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en). Before running this application, you must install inquirer by typing "npm install i" into the command-line.
